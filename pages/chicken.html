    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is the crispiest, spiciest, homemade fried chicken I have ever tasted! It is equally good served hot or cold and has been a picnic favorite in my family for years.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 1/2tbsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tbsp garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tbsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp poultry seasoning</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups beer</li>
        <li>1 quart vegetable oil</li>
        <li>3lb whole chicken</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In one medium bowl, mix together 3 cups of flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon black pepper, paprika and poultry seasoning. In a separate bowl, stir together 1 1/3 cups flour, salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, egg yolks and beer. You may need to thin with additional beer if the batter is too thick.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Moisten each piece of chicken with a little water, then dip in the dry mix. Shake off excess and dip in the wet mix, then dip in the dry mix once more.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the chicken pieces in the hot oil. Fry for 15 to 18 minutes, or until well browned. Smaller pieces will not take as long. Large pieces may take longer. Remove and drain on paper towels before serving.</li>
    </ol>
