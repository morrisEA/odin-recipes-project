    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4> Pizza Sauce</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>12oz tomato paste</li>
        <li>1tsp dried oregano, crushed</li>
        <li>1tsp dried basil, crushed</li>
        <li>1/2tsp garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2tsp onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2tsp sugar</li>
        <li>1/2tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/4tsp black pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Pizza Dough</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>3 1/4 cup all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1/4oz Yeast</li>
        <li>1tbs sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Toppings</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>6oz Pepperoni</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li>For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste .</li>
        <li>For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
        <li>Knead for about 4 minutes, on a floured surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRiseÂ® Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
        <li>For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, rotate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking.</li>
    </ol>
